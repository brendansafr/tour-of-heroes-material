# Tour of Heroes Material

Build on top of Google's [Tour of Heroes app and tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial), implementing [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

## Serve

Run

```
ng serve
```

and navigate to http://localhost:4200/, or run

```
ng serve --open
```

and angular will attempt to launch a browser.

## Tests

Testing is not completed

> Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
> 
> Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
